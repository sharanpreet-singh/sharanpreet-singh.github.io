## üìà Work Experience
**Estimating Support Officer @ Harvey Norman Commercial Projects Division, Port Melbourne (October 2022 - Present)**
<br>
In my current role, I specialize in data analysis of product pricing, maintain cost databases, and collaborate with cross-functional teams to ensure accurate cost estimations. Additionally, I identify cost-saving opportunities and provide recommendations to enhance efficiency and cost-effectiveness through collaborative efforts.

**Data and AI Intern @ News Corp, Melbourne (July 2023 - August 2023)**
<br>
I contributed to the development of a prototype product utilizing Natural Language Processing Algorithms. I also had the chance to learn and collaborate with journalists, assisting in enhancing storytelling through data analysis.

**Customer Relationship Management Administrator @ Planned Resources, Docklands (August 2022 - January 2023)**
<br>
I focused on standardizing the CRM input process and maintaining data quality, as well as managing and optimizing the CRM to streamline operations and boost productivity. I conducted extensive client research to support sales efforts and collaborated closely with consultants to identify potential clients and business development opportunities. Additionally, I performed in-depth data analysis using Microsoft Excel to ensure accurate and comprehensive data sets for effective decision-making, aligning efforts with key performance indicators (KPIs).

**Operations Analyst, Collegedunia Web Private Limited, India (December 2019 - December 2020)**
<br>
I employed analytical techniques and data-driven insights to optimize revenue streams and execute successful marketing campaigns from platforms like Facebook (Meta) Ads, AdWords, and TikTok Ads using data extracted and analyzed via SQL and Excel respectively. I collaborated closely with clients, prepared technical documents for API integration, and conducted in-depth performance analysis of campaigns, measuring critical metrics. I also successfully developed and implemented a strategic roadmap for an additional product as the Operations Head, aligning it with overall business objectives and market demands.

## üïµÔ∏è Projects
**1. Analysing the Climate Data of Melbourne and Sydney**
<br> 
This project rigorously examined and compared the distribution patterns of Maximum Temperature and Solar Exposure in Melbourne and Sydney. Employing histograms, normal distribution overlays, and Quantile-Quantile plots, the study investigated normality. Findings revealed deviations from normal distribution for Max_Temperature in both cities, with similar departures noted in Solar_Exposure. Despite resemblances in central tendencies, the observed ranges didn't align with normal distribution criteria. Acknowledging sample sizes (n > 30) and potential adherence to the Central Limit Theorem for sample mean distribution, significant departures from normality were evident. These deviations offer avenues for further statistical inquiry within climate data analysis despite departure from expected normal distributions.

**2. Data Driven Analysis of Global Life Expectancy Data**
<br> 
In this project, I  utilized a two-sample t-test to examine disparities in life expectancy between males and females. Despite non-normal distributions revealed by Q-Q and histogram plots, the Central Limit Theorem validated the t-test's application due to the substantial sample size. However, Levene‚Äôs Test highlighted unequal variance assumptions. Employing the t-test accounting for unequal variances, a statistically significant difference emerged in life expectancy between genders. Notably, females exhibited a notably higher life expectancy than males, indicating a substantive difference in means. An acknowledged limitation involved the absence of data for certain countries, constraining the study's extrapolation. Conversely, the study's strength lies in its capacity to generalize life expectancy trends from recent data, although acknowledging historical variations where females didn't consistently exhibit higher life expectancies, notably in the 19th century. Thus, outcomes from samples in different historical periods might significantly vary.
